## The official repository for the Scala 3 New Features course

Powered by [Rock the JVM!](rockthejvm.com)

This repository contains the code we wrote during  Rock the JVM's [Scala 3 New Features course](https://rockthejvm.com/p/scala-3-new-features). Unless explicitly mentioned, the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.

### Installation

How to install:
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as it's a simple IDEA project

### Getting Started

Run this command in a git terminal to reset the code in its starting/clean state:

```
git checkout start
```

This repo also has Git tags for intermediate states of the code while we were working in the course. You can check out the appropriate tags for the different stages of the course. Useful especially for longer exercises where we modify the same code over multiple videos.

The tags are:

* `start`
* `1.1-core-syntax`
* `1.2-givens`
* `1.3-not-givens`
* `1.4-extension-methods`
* `1.5-implicit-conversions`
* `1.6-minor-changes`
* `2.1-infix`
* `2.2-new-function-features`
* `2.3-exports`
* `2.4-union-intersection-types`
* `2.5-enums`
* `2.6-opaque-types`
* `2.7-match-types`
* `2.8-type-lambdas`
* `3.1-syntax`
* `3.2-organization`
